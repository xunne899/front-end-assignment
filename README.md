# Summary

 A Singapore-based website assignment. Technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were utilized. GIMP was used to modify text, fonts, and layout design per the client's requests, and to slice PSD files into various images which were then integrated into the website. The site was designed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. JavaScript functions were implemented to ensure smooth transitions between these views without refreshing the page. The mediaQuery.addEventListener method was used to handle screen size changes, supporting browsers like Firefox and other browsers. Semantic HTML tags such as header, body, main, section, and footer were incorporated throughout the site.
